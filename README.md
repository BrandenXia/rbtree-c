# rbtree-c

[STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/master)-style single header
implementation of red-black trees in C

This is **NOT** production quality code. It is intended for my algorithm class.

## Usage

In **one** of the source files, define `RBTREE_IMPL` before including the header:

```c
#define RBTREE_IMPL
#include "rbtree.h"
```
